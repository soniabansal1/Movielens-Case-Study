Objective:

To perform the analysis using the Exploratory Data Analysis technique. I need to find features affecting the ratings of any particular movie and build a model to predict the movie ratings.


Analysis Tasks to be performed:

Import the three datasets
Create a new dataset [Master_Data] with the following columns MovieID Title UserID Age Gender Occupation Rating. (Hint: (i) Merge two tables at a time. (ii) Merge the tables using two primary keys MovieID & UserId)
Explore the datasets using visual representations (graphs or tables), also include your comments on the following:
User Age Distribution
User rating of the movie “Toy Story”
Top 25 movies by viewership rating
Find the ratings for all the movies reviewed by for a particular user of user id = 2696
Feature Engineering:
            Use column genres:

Find out all the unique genres (Hint: split the data in column genre making a list and then process the data to find out only the unique categories of genres)
Create a separate column for each genre category with a one-hot encoding ( 1 and 0) whether or not the movie belongs to that genre. 
Determine the features affecting the ratings of any particular movie.
Develop an appropriate model to predict the movie ratings
